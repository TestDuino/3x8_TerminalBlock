# 3x8 Terminal Block
Simple 3x8 terminal block, alternative to Wago. The nominal current of a single port is 2A, 250V. Designed for mounting on a DIN rail.

## PCB manufacturing
Schematics, gerbers and Bill of Materials (BOM) are available under *Electronic Design* directory. PCBs can be oredered on JLCPCB or any other PCB manufacturer. It is recommended to buy components from reliable sources like Mouse, Farnell, Digikey, TME. All symbols and footprints on the schematics was acquired from mouser page.
